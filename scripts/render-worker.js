/**
 * Render background-worker entrypoint — the always-on replacement for the Heroku worker
 * ($50 Standard-2X  ->  $7 Render Starter). NO Redis / BullMQ.
 *
 * It covers exactly the gap the local Mac fleet does NOT: the four "sync-only" platforms
 * (workday, icims, oracle, successfactors), plus the worker's maintenance loops. The Macs
 * still crawl the other 9 platforms + the workable marketplace, so between this box and the
 * Macs, everything the Heroku worker did is covered — and the worker can be scaled to 0.
 *
 *   crawl    — forks scripts/crawl-companies-local.js (ATS=the 4), the SAME claim-and-crawl
 *              (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED) loop the Macs use; auto-restarts if it exits.
 *   maintain — description + classification backfill, dead-job pruning, 90-day stale cleanup
 *              (copied verbatim from src/worker.js).
 *
 * Render config:  Build `npm ci`  ·  Start `node scripts/render-worker.js`  ·  env DATABASE_URL
 * Tune for the 512MB/low-CPU Starter via env: CRAWL_ATS, CONCURRENCY, BATCH, PG_POOL_MAX.

  // the batches that did run came back 28% dead. That backlog is dead postings served as live.
  //
  // The candidate SELECT is a sequential scan (cost ~694k, no usable index — `id % N` is not
  // sargable and the OR spans jobs and companies), and that cost is paid once per call whatever
  // the limit. So take more per call rather than calling more often: 3000 every 20 minutes is
  // ~9000/hr and a full pass in ~12 days, for roughly the same number of scans per hour.
  //
  // concurrency stays at 10 ON PURPOSE. checkUrl buffers each response twice (res.text() then
  // .toLowerCase()), so peak memory scales with concurrency, not with limit — the batch array
  // itself is only ~600KB at 3000 rows. This runs in the parent process, which shares the
  // 512MB Starter with the 224MB-capped crawler child; raising concurrency is what would put
  // that child's headroom at risk.
  //
  // Batches cannot overlap: the next timer is scheduled after the await, so a slow batch simply
  // delays the following one.
  // 5000 is now affordable: dropping the ORDER BY from the candidate query (see
  // dead-job-check.js) took it from a full scan-and-sort of the eligible population to a scan
  // that stops at LIMIT — 20,000 rows in 33s where 1,000 previously blew past 60s. At ~8s for
  // this batch there is ample headroom under the worker's ceiling.
  //
  // 5000 every 20 minutes is ~15,000/hr, versus the 400/hr that could not keep up with a 2.7M
  // backlog. Concurrency stays at 10: checkUrl buffers each body twice and this shares 512MB
  // with the 224MB-capped crawler child.
