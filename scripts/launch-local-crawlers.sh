# SPLIT WITH THE RENDER WORKER, 2026-08-06. The Render worker (job-aggregator-va, CRAWL_ATS)
# owns workday, greenhouse, bamboohr, smartrecruiters and rippling — the platforms with working
# apply automation. They belong on always-on infrastructure: this Mac can be asleep and the home
# connection can drop, and those are the jobs users actually apply to.
#
# This fleet therefore keeps the rest, and picks up the large platforms whose apply automation
# is not built yet (icims/oracle/successfactors). Prospective inventory is the right thing to
# run on the machine that might go offline.
#
# The partition below must stay DISJOINT FROM CRAWL_ATS as well as within itself — two crawlers
# on one ATS means duplicate writes and both racing the same last_synced_at claims.

# Instance A (lever): works fine crawled DIRECT, so force PROXY_DISABLED=1 — the IPRoyal
# residential proxy is metered/often-down, and routing lever through it just fails (100% errors
# when the proxy lapses). bamboohr moved to the Render worker.

# don't IP-block, so the laptop's own residential IP is enough — the proxy added nothing
# but a socket leak. On the metered IPRoyal proxy they ran 100% errors (EADDRNOTAVAIL,
# ephemeral-port exhaustion) for ~71h and stored 0 jobs; direct they flow at hundreds/min.

# plus the backfills running, the database went IO-bound (2 autovacuum workers 25min into a 23GB
# TOAST, a base backup mid-checkpoint, 8 of 9 active queries waiting), and the description
# backfill's candidate scan — the most timeout-sensitive query we run — started failing and
# cooling off platforms for an hour at a time. 76 cool-offs in one stretch.
#
# icims and taleo are the two worst offenders and the two with the least value: no apply
# automation, so users cannot act on the jobs, and both ran badly anyway — icims 285 errors over
# 1,000 companies, taleo 131 errors at 1 company/min. Dropping them buys back write capacity for

# Disjoint from both, per the rule above.
#
# Cheapest partition in the fleet per job stored: one request per company to

# no per-job detail fetch and no description backfill - the opposite of taleo/icims, which were
# retired for costing a detail request per job.
#
# The adapter hardcodes .personio.de, which looks wrong for the ~37% of boards recorded on
# .personio.com. It is not: the TLDs are interchangeable on the XML feed, verified on both
# .com- and .de-registered tenants (identical position counts). Do not "fix" it per-tenant.
#
# Probe of 120 boards before launching: 73% serve jobs (12.9 avg), 27% 404 on a stale slug,

# list on these instances is the real allowlist. Concurrency 2 and a longer per-company

# (see src/adapters/taleo.js), so a board is slow even after the adapter was parallelised.

# Unordered it is 3.4s for 500 rows and 33s for 20,000, so a big batch is now affordable where

# CONCURRENCY was 25 and that number is about DATABASE cost, which is no longer the binding
