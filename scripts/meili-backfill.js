/**
 * Copy existing jobs straight into the search index. READ-ONLY against Postgres.
 *
 * The first approach seeded by setting index_dirty_at on every row so the normal sync loop
 * would pick them up. That is right for ongoing changes but wrong for a one-time backfill: the
 * rows have not changed, so there is nothing to record, and marking 2.8M rows means 2.8M
 * UPDATEs, each maintaining all 26 indexes on the table (2.4GB of them). Measured on the live
 * database: marking 10k rows took 30-70s and produced sustained 5xx on the API; reading the
 * same 10k takes ~10s and dirties nothing — no dead tuples, no autovacuum churn.
 *
 * The outbox trigger still handles everything ongoing. This only fills the backlog.
 *
 *   node scripts/meili-backfill.js              # from the start
 *   FROM_ID=12345 node scripts/meili-backfill.js
 *
 * Must run somewhere that can reach the index — it is a private service, so that means inside
 * Render, not a laptop.
 *
 * Env: BF_BATCH(2000) BF_PAUSE_MS(500) FROM_ID(0) CHECKPOINT(/tmp/meili-backfill.pos)
