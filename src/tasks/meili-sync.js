/**
 * Ship changed jobs into the search index.
 *
 * Driven by the index_dirty_at outbox column (see src/db/schema.js). A trigger sets it on every
 * insert and on any update that touches an indexed field, which is the only way to catch all
 * ~30 writers — several of them are one-off scripts running on a laptop that will never import
 * application code, and `jobs` has no updated_at to poll on.
 *
 * Claims a batch, ships it, then clears the flag only for rows whose index_dirty_at has not
 * moved since the claim. If a writer re-dirties a row mid-flight, the flag stays set and the
 * row is picked up again — losing an update is worse than shipping one twice, and Meilisearch
 * upserts on primary key so a duplicate costs nothing.
 *
 * Soft-deleted rows (removed_at set) are deleted from the index rather than indexed, so the
 * board never surfaces a dead posting.

// Ceiling on how fast this loop can push documents at Meilisearch.
//
// These were 1000 x 20 = 20,000 documents per tick (the tick re-arms 60s after the previous one
// finishes). On 2026-08-08 a 615k-row bulk import dirtied the outbox, this loop ran flat out to
// drain it, and the Meilisearch service — 2GB on Render — was OOM-killed three times in half an
// hour. Each kill takes the index offline; jobs-search.js then returns null and /api/jobs falls
// back to Postgres, where the same query cannot beat the statement timeout on 5M rows. So an
// indexing burst surfaces to users as a failing search endpoint.
//
// TRIED AND REVERTED 2026-08-25/26. The cap was raised to 12 batches on the reasoning that
// Meilisearch had moved from Standard (2GB, 1 cpu) to Pro Plus (8GB, 4 cpus), so the ceiling that
// caused those three OOM kills no longer applied. Meilisearch handled it fine — p90 search
// latency actually improved from 3,240ms to 172ms. But the reasoning checked the wrong box: the
// binding constraint is the WORKER this loop runs in, not the index it writes to. See the note on
// MAX_BATCHES below.
//
// The problem it was meant to solve was real: the drain was pinned at its 2,000 ceiling cycle
// after cycle, and because the outbox trigger fires on removed_at, a retired job only leaves
// search once its row drains — pruned jobs were still being returned an hour later. That backlog
// has since cleared on its own, so the cap is no longer the bottleneck.
const BATCH = parseInt(process.env.MEILI_SYNC_BATCH || '500', 10);
// REVERTED to 4 on 2026-08-26. Raising this to 12 was sized against MEILISEARCH's memory (8GB
// on Pro Plus) — the wrong box. The limit that matters is the WORKER's, and job-aggregator-va is
// a 512MB starter instance that already runs company syncs, the classification backfill,
// dead-job pruning at concurrency 10 and the demand crawler in the same process. Tripling the
// rows this loop holds per tick pushed it over: the worker was SIGKILLed (exit 137) eight times
// between 23:13 and 04:43, having not crashed at all beforehand.
//
// The raise is also no longer needed. It was made because the outbox was saturated and retired
// jobs were taking an hour to leave search; that backlog has since cleared and ticks now drain
// 255-1,089 documents, comfortably inside 500 x 4 = 2,000. If the backlog ever returns, the fix
// is to give the worker more memory, not to make this loop hold more.
