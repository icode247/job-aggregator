/**
 * Meilisearch-backed implementation of the job search read path.
 *
 * Mirrors jobsRepo.findActive / countActive so the route can swap between engines without
 * changing its response shape. Returns null when the index is unavailable or the filter set is
 * one it cannot serve faithfully, and the caller falls back to Postgres — a slower correct
 * answer always beats a fast wrong one.
 *
 * Why this exists: /api/facets, /api/roles and /api/trending each aggregate over 2.8M live rows
 * in Postgres. Even indexed they cost hundreds of ms; uncached and cold they hit 40-60s and blew
 * the statement timeout. Meilisearch returns those counts as a byproduct of the search it has
 * already run, and adds typo tolerance and relevance ranking Postgres full-text cannot.
